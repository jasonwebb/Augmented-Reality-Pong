Augmented Reality Pong (sometimes called "Giant Pong") is an openFrameworks implementation of Pong that utilizes webcam data to give users physical control over two paddles on screen.

INTRODUCTION
================
Originally, the idea behind this project was to create a system that can allow abitrary input from webcams (infrared blobs) to control the game. It was first debutted in Spring 2011 as an interactive table-top, using a projector and a PS3Eye webcam, modified for IR sensitivity, installed directly above a large table, which used the positions of users' hands acting as the input for the webcam (infrared LEDs and batteries were sewn onto wristbands and worn by the users). Eventually, we'd like to scale this system up to allow multiple users to play a game of pong on a very large arena like a basketball court.

REQUIREMENTS
==============
- openFrameworks 0062+ (not tested with 007)
  + ofxOpenCV addon
  + ofxBox2d addon
  + MSAlibs
- webcam (PS3Eyes are great, especially when modified for IR)

USAGE
=======
First, install this project in your OF apps folder. Don't forget to install the necessary addons!

Once you compile and run the program, you will see a blank stage the size of your screen. Two blobs have to be detected in the webcam for a game to take place and paddles to be visible. Use the keyboard controls outlined below to calibrate your webcam until you can obtain reliable blobs corresponding to the feature you want to track. 

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
====================
[space] = background subtract
+ = increase threshold
- = decrease threshold
i = increase min blob size
u = decrease min blob size
k = increase max blob size
j = decrease max blob size
v = verbose mode
r = start a new match
